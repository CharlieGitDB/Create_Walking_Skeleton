# Create_Walking_Skeleton


This is my first attempt at a desktop application using electron. (The same utility that has made Slack, GitHubs IDE Atom, and many more)

It runs on Linux, OSX, and Windows.

I currently do not have production executables of this program.

This program allows you to enter a path way on your local computer and then create a walking skeleton of a Node.js program so that it takes the hassle of bringing all of the node modules you need and rewriting the same server over and over again.

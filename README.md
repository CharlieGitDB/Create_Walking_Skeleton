# Create_Walking_Skeleton

Technologies Used: jQuery, Electron

This is my first attempt at a desktop application using Electron. (The same utility that has made Slack, GitHubs IDE Atom, and many more)

It runs on Linux, OSX, and Windows.

This program allows you to enter a path way on your local computer and then create a walking skeleton of a Node.js program so that it takes the hassle of bringing all of the node modules you need and rewriting the same server over and over again.

Due to Electron's required files to compile the program the base production size of an Electron application is around 40MB. This means that because my application is so small it is highly impractical because it ends up taking up 100+ MB of space.  If you have a lot of memory or just don't care about the file space you can download the Windows production version of this here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/le5t0hc1b940rkn/CreateSkeletonInstaller.exe?dl=0
